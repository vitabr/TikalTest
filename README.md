TheMovieDB.org api is not easy to use at all. 
Need about 4 hours just to understand the way you it work, 
content of results, how to get trailers and where posters realy located at.

Ended up by using sudjested android api library.

Test specifications mantion usage of Loaders, CursorLoaders and Content providers.
But as there is no need to share results with external apps, I did all 
the same functionality by using Realm, as much faster and easy way to same approach.
